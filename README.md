# Portfolio-Blog Front-End React/Redux Application 
  
Portfolio-Blog is an app I created to document my projects and showcase my learning journey in tech through blogs.

To fully interact with the frontend side you will need to clone the API built with **Ruby on Rails** [portfolio-blog-api] here (https://github.com/Oroko/portfolio-blog-api)

## Front End Technologies I used 
1. React UI library [React](https://reactjs.org/)
2. Redux for state management [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
3. Chakra Ui [chakra ui ](https://chakra-ui.com/)


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

3. Add email functionality so that users who read my blogs or visit my projects can send me Email message
4. Style up the whole site more as i get better at using chakra UI
